        <p>
          Ramadan , sometimes spelled ramadhan or ramaḍān ( Arabic : رمضان ? ) 1
          , is the ninth month of the Hijri calendar 2 , 3 . The only month
          whose name appears in the Koran 4 , 5 , Ramadan is for Muslims the
          "holy month par excellence" 6 because it is the month of fasting (or
          Saum ) and contains Laylat al-Qadr (the night of Destiny) 7 . In
          French as in English , the word “ramadan” is used interchangeably to
          designate the holy month for Muslims and, by metonymy , fasting or
          saoum 8 . Fasting in the month of Ramadan is one of the five pillars
          of Islam . During this month, Muslims, that is to say adults and
          children who have reached puberty according to the currents of Islam,
          must not eat , drink or have sexual intercourse from dawn to dusk .
          sun 2 , 9 . Ramadan is considered the “month of charity” because, when
          it ends, the faithful must pay alms, zakât al-fitr 10 . It is also the
          month in which many other significant events in Islamic history are
          commemorated .6 .

            The human body is then cleansed of old cells, fats, waste and toxins
            that have accumulated during the year through its diet and activity.
            Fasting also rejuvenates the skin, strengthens the teeth,
            strengthens the hair, soothes the senses, increases concentration,
            etc.

          <p>
            Fasting in the month of Ramadan is one of the five pillars of Islam.
            During this month, Muslims, that is to say adults and children who
            have reached puberty according to the currents of Islam, must not
            eat, drink or have sexual intercourse from dawn to dusk. sun.

        <h2><strong>What breaks the fast?</strong></h2>
        <main>
          <p>
            <strong>1. The sexual relationship</strong><br />
            Fasting is first of all abstaining from eating, drinking and having
            sexual intercourse during the day. Therefore, when the faster
            commits sexual intercourse, his fast is canceled. He must
            necessarily proceed to a so-called expiatory repentance (Al –
            Kaffârah) and which consists of: the freeing of a slave (believer),
            if he does not find a slave, he must fast two (02) months
            consecutively, if he cannot fast consecutively for two months, that
            is to say that he has a valid impediment according to the
            legislation, then he must feed sixty (60) poor people, with a
            quantity of two (02) Moud (approximately 1/2 kg) for each, of the
            food that people prefer to consume the most in the country.<br /><br />
            <strong>2. Ejaculation</strong><br />
            If this ejaculation is provoked by hugs, sensational touches, looks
            of carnal desire, masturbation, ... or other act depending on the
            will of the faster; then his fast is cancelled. This person will
            nevertheless have to continue his fast and repair this wrong on an
            equivalent day, after Ramadan. However, if this ejaculation takes
            place during sleep, the fasting person has nothing to fear because
            his fast remains valid; especially since it would have happened
            independently of his will. In this case, he must do the great
            ablutions (complete washing of the body) to get rid of the
            defilement [Aj – Janâba]. <br />
            <br />
            <strong>3. Eating or drinking voluntarily</strong><br />
            The faster who drinks or eats voluntarily, his fast is cancelled. He
            must also proceed to the so-called expiatory repentance (Al –
            Kaffârah) as in the case of sexual intercourse. However, whoever
            eats or drinks by forgetfulness, his fast remains valid, as it is
            said in the following Hadith: " Whoever fasts, then eats or drinks
            by forgetfulness, let him finish his fast, for it is Allah who fed
            and watered ” [Hadith recognized unanimously authentic.]. However,
            Imam Malick advises to resume such a fast, out of caution. Beyond
            eating or drinking, any solid, liquid or gas introduced into the
            stomach, VOLUNTARILY, invalidates the fast. Also the fact of taking
            nutrients intravenously, carrying out blood transfusion to the
            fasting person or blood dialysis, invalidates his fast because it
            constitutes food for him. But the non-food injection does not cancel
            the fast, even if it is advised against by some scholars.
